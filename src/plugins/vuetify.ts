/* Vuetify-loader

Keeping track of all the components youâ€™re using can be a real chore. The vuetify-loader
alleviates this pain by automatically importing all the Vuetify components you use, where you use them.
This will also make code - splitting more effective, as webpack will only load the components required for that chunk to be displayed. */
